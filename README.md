## About Me
Hello! I am Sayali Gayake, a third-year *Computer Engineering* student at *AVCOEÂ College*.

## Description
The **Online Examination System** is a database-driven project designed to efficiently manage examinations, calculate student marks, and generate performance reports. The system utilizes SQL for database queries, PL/SQL procedures for automated grading, and triggers for real-time notifications of mark changes.

## Features
- **Marks Calculation**: Automated SQL queries to calculate marks for each student based on their responses.
- **Grade Generation**: PL/SQL procedures for generating grades based on predefined grading criteria.
- **Notifications**: Database triggers to notify students via email or system logs whenever there is a change in their marks.

## Technologies Used
- **Database**: MySQL or Oracle Database
- **SQL**: For creating and querying the database.
- **PL/SQL**: For procedures and complex operations.
- **Triggers**: For automating notifications.
